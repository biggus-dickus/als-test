# Art Lebedev Studio Test Assignment

Blinding signs flap
Flicker, flicker, flicker blam. Pow, pow!

**Languages employed:** HTML, SCSS and JS (ES6+) with Babel transpiling to aid the technologically-impaired browsers. Bundling is powered by Gulp.

### Deployed project url
https://biggus-dickus.github.io/als-test/

### Deploy locally
1. Clone the project.
2. Install required dependencies (`npm i`) and run the production build  `npm run build` OR simply run the `./build.sh` script in the project root directory. It will take a while, so you might as well go get a cup of coffee.

### Developer build
Follow the aforementioned steps, but run `npm start` instead of `npm run build`. The local changes-syncing server will spring up on `localhost:1488`.

Naturally, you must have **nodeJS** (LTS v.8.11.3 at the time of project completion) and **npm** installed locally.
